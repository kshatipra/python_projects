# Day 1 of drafting code that I have learnt

# 1. To display some information on the screen

print("Hello world!") #printing a message
print(":)") #printing an emoji
print("12345") #printing numbers
print("Hello This is a thirty day challenge\nI don't know why I am typing so much hahahhahahah but here it is\nto make this longggg!!") #printing a blockk, \n is to tell that we need a new line here after this. 

# 2. To perform basic arithmetic operations

print(5 + 3) #addition
print(5 - 3) #subtraction
print(5 * 3) #multiplication
print(5 / 3) #division

# 3. To assign values to variables

x = 5 #assigning 5 to variable x
y = 3 #assigning 3 to variable y

print(x + y) #printing the sum of x and y
print(x - y) #printing the sum of x and y
print(x * y) #printing the sum of x and y
print(x / y) #printing the sum of x and y
print(x % y) #what do you think this is?

#4. Example, Number of minutes in  two years
num_of_minutes = 356*2*24*60 
print(num_of_minutes)

#So this was it, printing something.. 
#What is happening?? :
#The computer doesn’t understand what you are writing because it doesn’t speak our language. 
# So, we use a common tongue called programming. We write code that the compiler understands. 
# The compiler translates this code into a form that the computer can understand and execute. Finally, the computer processes this and displays the output.

#What am I?? the sentances with # are comments, theser are for us and others to know whats happening, compiler just ignores them, just like our brain ignores important stuff !
